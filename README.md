By: Haley Mitchell, Manuella Kwawu, Samantha Silva, Amy Zhou, Zixu Li

This project aims to analyze and forecast global CO2 emissions. 
It provides a brief insight into the evolution of CO2 emissions over nearly 5 decades, from 1960 to 2018. 
The project focuses on generating and comparing predictions of CO2 emissions with actual recorded emissions for 2019 & 2020 and further generates forecasts for 2021 to 2028.
